# Nora — AI Work Intelligence

Nora captures every Kiro session, extracts patterns, decisions, and anti-patterns, then feeds them back as context and steering. Your AI gets smarter every session.

100% local. Zero bytes leave your machine. BYOK (Bring Your Own Key).

## Onboarding

### Step 1: Check Prerequisites

Verify the following are installed:

- **Python 3.9+** — Run `python3 --version` to confirm
- **git** — Run `git --version` to confirm

If either is missing, halt setup and inform the user.

### Step 2: Install Nora Engine

Check if Nora is already installed by looking for `~/.kernora/app/daemon.py`.

If Nora is NOT installed, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kernora-ai/nora.git /tmp/nora-install && bash /tmp/nora-install/install.sh && rm -rf /tmp/nora-install
```

This installs the engine to `~/.kernora/`, creates a virtual environment, initializes the database, starts the daemon and dashboard, and configures auto-start on login.

If Nora IS already installed, skip to Step 3.

### Step 3: Configure API Key

Nora needs one LLM API key for session analysis (BYOK — your key, your machine). Check if any of these environment variables are set:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` (recommended)
- `GEMINI_API_KEY`
- `AWS_PROFILE` (for Bedrock)

If none are set, ask the user to provide one. They can also use local Ollama — edit `~/.kernora/config.toml` and set `provider = "ollama"`.

### Step 4: Install Kiro Hooks

Create the following hooks in `.kiro/hooks/` for this workspace:

**Hook: nora-session-capture** (triggers on Agent Stop)
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "Nora Session Capture",
  "description": "Captures session transcript and sends to Nora for analysis",
  "version": "1",
  "when": { "type": "agentStop" },
  "then": {
    "type": "runCommand",
    "command": "python3 ~/.kernora/app/kiro_stop.py"
  }
}
```

**Hook: nora-tool-shield** (triggers on Pre Tool Use)
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "Nora Tool Shield",
  "description": "Validates tool invocations against danger patterns and learned anti-patterns",
  "version": "1",
  "when": { "type": "preToolUse" },
  "then": {
    "type": "runCommand",
    "command": "python3 ~/.kernora/app/kiro_spec_shield.py"
  }
}
```

**Hook: nora-tool-monitor** (triggers on Post Tool Use)
```json
{
  "enabled": true,
  "name": "Nora Tool Monitor",
  "description": "Checks tool output against known error signatures from past sessions",
  "version": "1",
  "when": { "type": "postToolUse" },
  "then": {
    "type": "runCommand",
    "command": "python3 ~/.kernora/app/kiro_post_tool.py"
  }
}
```

### Step 5: Copy Hook Scripts

If the hook Python scripts don't exist at `~/.kernora/app/kiro_*.py`, download them:

```bash
for f in kiro_stop.py kiro_spec_shield.py kiro_post_tool.py steering_writer.py; do
  [ ! -f "$HOME/.kernora/app/$f" ] && curl -sfL "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kernora-ai/kiro-claw/main/hooks/$f" -o "$HOME/.kernora/app/$f"
done
```

### Step 6: Generate Initial Steering

Run the steering writer to generate initial steering files:

```bash
python3 ~/.kernora/app/steering_writer.py
```

This creates `~/.kiro/steering/nora-patterns.md`, `nora-decisions.md`, and `nora-antipatterns.md`. These are read by Kiro automatically on every prompt — the highest-value integration.

### Step 7: Verify Installation

Confirm Nora is running:

1. Check daemon: `ls ~/.kernora/daemon.sock` (should exist)
2. Check dashboard: `curl -sf http://localhost:2742` (should return HTML)
3. Check steering: `ls ~/.kiro/steering/nora-*.md` (should list 3 files)

If all three pass, tell the user: "Nora is installed. Your sessions will be captured and analyzed automatically. Steering files update after each session."

## Available MCP Server

### nora

**Connection:** Local stdio process

Nora's MCP server provides read-only access to your local session intelligence database (`~/.kernora/echo.db`). No network calls. No data leaves your machine.

**Tools:**

- **nora_search** — Full-text search across patterns, decisions, bugs, and insights from past sessions. Required: `query` (string).
- **nora_patterns** — List effective coding patterns, optionally filtered by project. Optional: `project` (string), `min_effectiveness` (number, 0-1).
- **nora_decisions** — List architectural decisions recorded across sessions. Optional: `project` (string).
- **nora_bugs** — List known bugs with severity, file path, and fix code. Optional: `status` (open/resolved/all), `severity` (critical/high/medium/low).
- **nora_stats** — Dashboard stats: session count, insights, patterns, decisions, open bugs, total tokens.
- **nora_session** — Get full details for a specific session by ID. Required: `session_id` (string).
- **nora_scope_validation** — Validate that planned execution scope is focused and safe before multi-file edits. Required: `intent` (string). Optional: `files_to_touch` (string array).
- **nora_skills** — Fetch distilled methodology from your team's highest-quality sessions.

## When to Load Steering Files

Nora generates three global steering files that Kiro reads automatically:

- Starting a new coding task → `nora-patterns.md` provides reusable patterns and playbooks
- Making architectural choices → `nora-decisions.md` provides past decisions and rationale
- About to modify code → `nora-antipatterns.md` warns about known mistakes and bugs

## How Nora Works

1. **You code normally.** Nora is silent during your session.
2. **Session ends.** The stop hook captures the transcript and sends it to the local daemon.
3. **Daemon analyzes.** Two-phase extraction: deterministic parsing + LLM analysis (using your own API key).
4. **Knowledge accumulates.** Patterns, decisions, and bugs stored in local SQLite.
5. **Steering evolves.** After each analysis, steering files regenerate with the latest intelligence.
6. **Next session is smarter.** Kiro reads the steering files. MCP tools answer questions about past work.

## Privacy

- 100% local — session transcripts never leave your machine
- BYOK — analysis uses YOUR API key (Anthropic, Gemini, Bedrock, or local Ollama)
- Zero telemetry, zero cloud storage, zero data sharing
- MCP server is read-only — cannot modify your code or database
- [Elastic License 2.0](https://github.com/kernora-ai/nora/blob/main/LICENSE)

## Configuration

Edit `~/.kernora/config.toml`:

```toml
[mode]
type = "byok"              # your key, your machine

[model]
provider = "anthropic"      # or "bedrock", "gemini", "ollama"

[analysis]
run_every_minutes = 60      # analysis frequency

[dashboard]
port = 2742                 # web UI at localhost:2742
```

## Troubleshooting

### Daemon not running
```bash
~/.kernora/venv/bin/python3 ~/.kernora/app/daemon.py &
```

### No steering files generated
Run manually: `python3 ~/.kernora/app/steering_writer.py`
If echo.db is empty, complete a few coding sessions first.

### MCP server not connecting
Verify the server starts: `~/.kernora/venv/bin/python3 ~/.kernora/app/nora_mcp.py`
Check for missing dependencies: `~/.kernora/venv/bin/pip install mcp`
